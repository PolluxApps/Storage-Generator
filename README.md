# Storage-Generator

Storage-Generator is a Python-based tool for generating and managing storage solutions.

## Features


Here’s a corrected version with improved grammar and spelling:

You can create "free storage" using a small loophole in YouTube's upload system.
Since you can upload unlimited videos, this repository converts all kinds of files into a video and back, allowing you to store them on YouTube.

This repository only handles conversion and decoding—it does not include the YouTube upload process due to uncertainty regarding YouTube's Terms of Service (TOS) on this method.

Use this tool with the YouTube API at your own risk!

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PolluxApps/Storage-Generator.git
